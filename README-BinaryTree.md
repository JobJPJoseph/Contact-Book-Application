# Binary Search Tree

## Tasks
    'constructor'
        The constructor will have a single property called 'this.root' that will be set to null by default;

    `insert`
        The method should accept a single argument that will represent a name. We need to hash the first character of the string. This will be used to sort the name into the buckets.

        After finding the bucket, we need to insert the name into the binary tree. We will hash the name itself to sort the tree.
