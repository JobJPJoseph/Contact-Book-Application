### Tasks
    `Hash Table`
        We need to create a Hash Table in order to store the names
        of the contacts based on the first letter in their name
    `Binary Search Tree`
        We need to create a BST for the buckets of the HashTable so sort and store the names.
    `User`
        We need to make a class that asks and check if the input is in the correct format
    `Interface`
        We need to make a class that resemble an interface for the user.
