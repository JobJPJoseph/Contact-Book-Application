## Concepts to Implement:
    * Hash Tables:
    * Binary Search Tree:

    * Mocha/Chai:
    * Single Respondsibility Principle:
    * Custom Erros:
    * Handling Errors:
    * ES6 syntax:
    * Context (binding):

### Tasks
    `Hash Table`
        We need to create a Hash Table in order to store the names
        of the contacts based on the first letter in their name
    `Binary Search Tree`
        We need to create a BST for the buckets of the HashTable so sort and store the names.
